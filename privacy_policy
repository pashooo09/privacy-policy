**Privacy Policy**

Last updated: [Date]

This privacy policy describes how [Your App Name] ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and handles your information when you use our mobile application.

**Information Collection and Use**

Our app does not require you to provide any personal information or create an account. The app allows users to create and manage football player profiles which can include names. These names can be nicknames or any pseudonym chosen by the user, and do not need to be personally identifiable.

**Data Storage**

All data entered into the app is stored locally on your device. We do not collect, store, or transmit any data to a server or cloud service. This means that all information remains on your device and is not accessible by us or any third parties.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the app. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

**Contact Us**

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: [Your Contact Information]

**Disclaimer**

This privacy policy was created to comply with the requirements set by Google Play. However, you should consider consulting with a professional to ensure that it fully complies with applicable legal requirements based on the specific details and jurisdiction of your app.

Remember to replace placeholders like `[Your App Name]` and `[Your Contact Information]` with the appropriate information for your app. This will make sure the policy is fully tailored to your application.
